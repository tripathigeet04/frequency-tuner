%this is a file to generate a sound file with a tone at a specific
%frequency

%frequency of the tone we want (Hz)
f = 440;

%amplitude of sound
amp = 1;

%sampling freq (Hz) (using max sample rate allowed for the sound()
%function which varies depending on the computers hardware)
fs=150000;

%time in seconds
t=0:(1/fs):2;

snd=amp*cos(2*pi*f*t);

% add in several background frequencies between 
freqs = random('unif',10,2000,1,15);

for i = 1:15
    snd = snd + (0.01*amp)*cos(2*pi*freqs(i)*t);
end


sound(snd,fs);

%% added part from meeting on 2-7-18



save generateSound.mat; %saving the sound that was made
%clear snd fs % removes variables if you want to
%^^^^if used, you must load the file again

%% save the sound above to a .wav file

%load generateSound.mat; %use only if the 'clear snd fs' is used above

%saving the sound previously made to a .wav file
filename= 'SOUND.wav'; %naming the sound that was created
audiowrite(filename,snd,fs);
[snd,fs]=audioread('SOUND.wav');
sound(snd,fs);
%sound is now saved in the same folder with the code
%clear sound

%keeps saying "Warning: Data clipped when writing file"
% what does that mean ^^
